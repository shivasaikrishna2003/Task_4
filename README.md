# Task_4

/**
 * Text-based Notes Manager (single-file, beginner friendly)
 *
 * Objective: Demonstrate simple persistence using FileWriter (write) and
 * FileReader/BufferedReader (read).
 *
 * How it works (high level):
 * 1) Add note -> appends your text to notes.txt using FileWriter.
 * 2) View notes -> reads the file using FileReader wrapped by BufferedReader.
 * 3) Clear notes -> truncates the file (empty it) using FileWriter (append=false).
 * 4) Change file -> switch to a different notes file path.
